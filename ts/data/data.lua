READ THIS FIRST: The following data (everything after this comment block) is
generated by a script. Any edits you make might get overwritten by a later
data dump. But, in some cases that may still be the right thing to do.

The script that is used to generate this data is located at
https://github.com/d0sboots/dyson-sphere-program, but running
it requires Python and the ability to extract resources from Unity. (More
detailed instructions are in the script.) For small tweaks, or if that proves
too difficult, this data format is designed to still be hand-maintainable.

Updating names or descriptions is relatively easy. In most cases, there should
only be one place to update. (Maybe two in the case of recipe/item names, which
are duplicated.) If item names change, you will also need to move the item's
page and File: entry to their new names.

Adding a new item or recipe is trickier, because of the ids. First, check that
it doesn't already exist in a disabled form. If it does, all you have to do is
remove the "disabled" field and it should activate.
Otherwise, you'll have to invent new ids. I suggest using large numbers (>8000)
to show that they're obviously made up, so it becomes clear what's happening
for the person who has to look at the diffs of the next import

Adding a new technology is the hardest of all, because the image name is
determined by the id, so you can't just make something up. Also, for all
additions you will need a program that can extract the Unity textures as PNGs
so they can be added too.

Data for all the items. Each entry is a table, keyed by the item's id. The
entries are sorted by id, although you can't count on this when using pairs()
in Lua.

The item data is mostly self-explanatory. Fields are omitted if they are not
relevant/present for the given item. The valid fields are:
    name - Title-Cased vs. what's in the game.
    type - The category of the item, not the full story for buildings
    grid_index - Where this appears in the item grid. The format is ZXXY,
                 where Z is 1 for components and 2 for buildings. Note that
                 this has the same format as the grid_index for recipes, but
                 different values - recipe grid_index is used with the
                 replicator, while item grid_index is used with filters (for
                 example).
    stack_size
    sub_id - Set for building with different types (i.e. conveyers), and also
             all the different energy producers.
    can_build - Mostly equivalent to "is_building?", except also true for
                Foundation.
    build_index - Where this appears in the build shortcut menus, in the form
                  ZXX, where Z is the top-level and XX is the inner level.
    is_fluid - boolean, omitted when false.
    energy - This is measured in Joules.
    fuel_chamber_boost - This is a floating-point number, so 1.0 corresponds
                         to a +100% boost.
    unlock_key - The item ID of an item that is used to determine the tech
                 unlock requirements of this item. For instance,
                 Accumulator(Full) is unlocked whenever Accumulator is,
                 without it being explicitly stated in the tech tree.
    explicit_tech_dep - The explicit tech dependency of this item, for display
                        purposes.
    mining_from - A free-text string that sometimes includes colored spans.
    explicit_produce_from - A text string that should name an item. Used for
                            items that are produced without conventional recipes.
    description - The in-game tooltip text. May include colored spans.
    disabled - If true, this item won't show up in the item grid. Set for
               items that are in the game data, but not accessible yet.
    image - Included as a comment only, this is the name of the item image
            as stored in the game files. It should be renamed to the item's
            name when uploaded.

Data for all the recipes. Each entry is a table, stored as a flat array. The
entries are sorted first by component/building, then by type, and lastly by id,
although with some tweaks so that different ranks of buildings come next to
each other. This is because Template:Crafting outputs items in the order they
are listed here.

The recipe data is mostly self-explanatory. Fields are omitted if they are not
relevant/present for the given recipe. The valid fields are:
    id
    name - Title-Cased vs. what's in the game.
    type - The type of building that makes the recipe
    outputs - What the recipe produces. This is an alternating array of
              "item_id, count, item_id, count, ..." As a result, there will
              always be an even number of elements.
    inputs - What the recipe requires. Same format as outputs.
    grid_index - Where this appears in the recipe grid. The format is ZXXY,
                 where Z is 1 for components and 2 for buildings. Note that
                 this has the same format as the grid_index for items, but
                 different values - recipe grid_index is used with the
                 replicator, while item grid_index is used with filters (for
                 example).
    handcraft - Can it be made in the replicator?
    seconds - How long to craft at 1x speed.
    explicit - Whether this is an "explicit" recipe, as opposed to the
               implicit or "primary" recipe for an item. You can tell the
               difference in-game because hovering over an explicit recipe
               shows "(Recipe)" in front of the name, and there's other
               differences in the tooltip.
    description - The in-game tooltip text. May include colored spans.
                  Generally only present (and used) for explicit recipes.
    disabled - If true, this item won't show up in the item grid. Set for
               items that are in the game data, but not accessible yet.
    image - Included as a comment only, this is the name of the item image
            as stored in the game files. It should be renamed to the item's
            name when uploaded. Generally only present for explicit recipes.

--[[
Data for all the techs. Each entry is a table, stored as a flat array. The
entries are sorted by id, which means that regular technologies come before
upgrades.

The tech data is mostly self-explanatory. Fields are omitted if they are not
relevant/present for the given tech. The valid fields are:
    id
    name - Title-Cased vs. what's in the game.
    hash_needed - The amount of hash needed to research, as a raw number.
                  Sometimes this is not the true amount, when it changes
                  per-level: See level_coef below.
    level_coef1 - This times the tech's (raw) level is added to hash_needed
                  to calculate the true amount. Used to create infinitely
                  researchable upgrades with linearly scaling costs.
    level_coef2 - This times [the tech's (raw) level squared] is added to
                  hash_needed to calculate the true amount. Used to create
                  infinitely researchable upgrades with quadratically scaling
                  costs.
    inputs - The items needed to complete one step of research. This has the
             same format as recipes: Alternating item_id, count, etc. For
             early techs this will be regular items, for later techs it will
             be matrices. Note that one step of research lasts one second,
             i.e. it provides 3600 hash. So the total number of items will be
             the count * hash_needed / 3600.
    recipes - What recipe_ids are unlocked by this tech. Omitted if empty.
    add_items - Item ids that are added directly to your inventory on
                completion of this tech. Same format as inputs. Omitted if empty.
    level - If present, indicates the "level" of this tech, usually indicating
            that this tech can be researched multiple times. Either the same
            tech can be researched (if there is a range between level and
            max_level), or there can be multiple instances with the same name
            (this is how upgrades are handled, since they have different icons
            and other differences at each level).
    max_level - The highest level that can be attained with this instance of
                the tech, but there may be other instances with the same name
                and different level ranges. Always paired with level.
    pre_techs - Prerequisite technologies. Omitted if empty.
    pre_techs_implicit - *Also* prerequisite technologies, but they couldn't
                         figure out how to draw these lines on the tech tree
                         and still have it look pretty. In other words, it's a
                         big hack. Omitted if empty.
    image - The name of the image. Usually the same as the id, but not always.
    position - Where it's located on the tech tree.
    description - The in-game tech-tree text. May include colored spans.
    conclusion - The text shown in the pop-up when you finish researching.
    disabled - If true, this tech shows up in the tech tree, but isn't
               available yet.
